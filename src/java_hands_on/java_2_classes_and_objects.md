# Problem : Find distance between 2D coordinates

Consider two dimension system with X and Y coordinates.


Write a program to <b>find distance between two points</b>, say X1, Y1 and X2, Y2.

Display the answer rounder to <u>three digits after decimal</u>.

The input will be provided as four numbers separated by space.

<b>E.g.</b>

Input 4 4 7 8 

Here, X1 will be 4, Y1 will be 4, X2 will be 7, Y2 will be 8.
Assume that input numbers will not have any decimal values.

The output with these values will be 5.000
